//     sessions never re-read briefs and updates that may have been
//     edited since the previous session.
//
//   - user-prompt-submit: wired as a Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook.
//     In bound sessions it injects a tiny per-prompt anchor that re-runs
//     the skill's drift (§4.11) and close-out (§4.7) checks; unbound
//     sessions are a no-op.

//     it's the only way to force the agent to re-read potentially-
